# Dynamic-Scrolling-
Dynamic Scrolling method to fully load a page ( used on Youtube as reference )
How the script works for the Dynamic loading of a youtube channels vidoe page. Firstly, the driver is set up, I have used ChromeDriver located on my desktop. Then a youtube page's video channel url is manually chosen. After this, the two methods differ, with the For Loop method looping over an arbitrary number greater than the number of videos that a channel has. Each iteration of a loop scrolls to the bottom of a page using the keys function from Selenium, then the BeautifulSoup import is used to obtain a selected property about an individual video. This property is stored in an array, "Video_arrray", and then the page is scrolled again. The loop checks that the number of videos stored in the "Video_array" as an element increases for each scroll to the bottom. When the element ceases to increase anymore and the kth value is equal to the kth + 1 value, the bottom of the page has been reached. The while loop method is the same, however, it is not required to know how many videos a channel has prior to running the script and therefore, is superior.
